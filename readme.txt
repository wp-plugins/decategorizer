"Decategorizer" removes 'category base' from your permalinks.
Quick setup and no editing required. 301 redirections are added 
automatically.

== Description ==

**THIS PLUGIN IS NOW OBSOLETE,PLEASE SWITCH TO 
['WP NO CATEGORY BASE'](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-no-category-base/) 
PLUGIN**

**Go to http://skyphe.org/code/wordpress/decategorizer/ for the 
explanation, thanks!**

"Decategorizer" will remove the category base from your category 
links, and turn your category URLs from something like 
"http://yourdomain/category/news/" to "http://yourdomain/news/". 

**Features:**

301 redirection for old category links added automatically;  
works with most permalink structures (please e-mail me or leave 
a comment on plugin's site if it doesn't work for you); 
you can safely use variables in your category URLs 
(http://yourdomain/news/?var=val); 
sitemap plugins compatible; 
it works with multiple subcategory links 
(http://yourdomain/categoryname/subcategoryname/subsubcategoryname/)

"Decategorizer" needs John Godley's
['Redirection'](http://urbangiraffe.com/plugins/redirection/) 
plugin to work and it will disable itself if Redirection is 
not installed.
Redirection version 2.x. is recommended (Last tested with v2.1.9)

= 0.6.2 =
* may 14th 2009
* i _might_ have broken a few sites with that 0.6 version, so i'll 
just apologize preemptively - sorry! :|
* version 0.6.2 is what version 0.6 was supposed to be
* big thanks goes to westi for explaining the event sequence of 
"update_option_permalink_structure" hook

* may 11th 2009

= 0.5.4.3 =
* february 20th 2009
* fixed the failing feed redirections for some permalink structures

= 0.5.3.2 =
* february 13th 2009
* changed redirection form from /cat_name/$ to 
^/(optional subfolder install)/cat_name/$, so if the install is in a 
subfolder (eg. http://domain.com/wordpress), that subfolder is now 
included in all redirections, just to make it failsafe.
* fixed failing home pagination in some cases (/HOME/page/2/) when
wordpress is installed in a subdirectory.

= 0.5.3.1 =
* february 12th 2009
fixed the randomly appearing slash at the end of category list when 
using 'wp_list_categories' function to print it

= 0.5.3 =
* february 10th 2009
* changed category redirections into regexes and added $ (end of string) 
at the end of expressions to make sure it parses category URLs _only_.
* also tested with wordpress MU 2.7 (and Redirection 2.1.7) and everything 
seems to work just fine :)

* minor code changes

= 0.5.1 =
* october 30th 2008

not installed/activated.
* Added notifications on top of the admin screens.
* Added 301 redirection for old permalinks containing /category_base/
(thanks Utilaje!).
* Added support for permalinks without trailing slash (thanks PH!).
* Redirections are now added when the plugin is activated, and on a 
few other occasions (see bottom of plugin file for all the hooks).
* Plugin no longer runs on each and every pageload. Hooray :)

= 0.4 =
* plugin now checks if redirection tables exist (d'oh) before 
starting to work. <del>It also checks whether adding redirections is 
actually needed (if you have no child categories, for example).</del>
-> removed in 0.5 for compatibility reasons ('/%postname%' permalinks).

= 0.3 =
* added automatic creation of redirection rules. 
PLEASE NOTE: Although I've been testing the plugin for the past 
two hours, do try it at home first.
REMINDER TO SELF: addslashes(), INSERT, save your sanity...

= 0.2.1 =
* instead of setting back category_base to its default value, 
the current value is used, so one's permalinks don't get broken if 
they decide to deactivate the plugin. Sorry for that, current users :/
Please check your 'category_base' value.

= 0.2 =
* added the filter to 'category_link' as well. No more 
"/category/" in links when using "Google XML Sitemaps" and "Dagon 
Design Sitemap Generator" plugins :)

== Installation == 

1.	Place the whole 'decategorizer' folder into your wordpress' 
	installation folder, under 'wp-content\plugins'.
2.	Go to WordPress administration->plugins page and make sure that 
	the plugin's name (Decategorizer) is on the list, but do not 
	activate it just yet.
3.	Install Urban Giraffe's Redirection plugin the same way, 
	if you haven't already done so.
4.	Activate 'Redirection' plugin.
5.  If you haven't had Redirection installed and used before now,
	go to Redirection plugin's options page so its database tables
	can be created.
6.	Go back to the plugin management page and activate Decategorizer.
7.	You're done.

== More info ==

To see the end result before you decide to install, please 
visit [wordpress.skyphe.org](http://wordpress.skyphe.org) and 
browse around. You'll notice that no url contains "category" and still 
everything works just fine.

I don't think I've ever written a readme before. Is it full of 
spelling and grammar errors? Too long? I suck at explaining how things 
work? Drop me an e-mail if something's bugging you about this text :)

== Plans for the next version? ==

Make it a "Redirection" extending class - does that make any sense?
Probably.

Or maybe move from "Redirection" completely and just write the values
to the .htaccess file?

Leave a comment here (Wordpress forums) or on my site, or send me an 
e-mail if you would like to see something added to the plugin.

Thanks for reading this :)
